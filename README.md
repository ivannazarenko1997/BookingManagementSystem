Bookstore Service

Bookstore Inventory Management System

üîé Overview

The Bookstore Inventory Management System is a RESTful web application designed to help bookstore owners efficiently manage their inventory.

It provides a secure API for:

Adding, updating, deleting, and searching books

Role-based authentication & authorization

Search functionality with Elasticsearch

This project was implemented as a contractor-style assignment, simulating a real-world delivery of a first production-ready version for a customer. The focus is on clean design, extensibility, and maintainability.

‚ú® Key Features

Book CRUD Operations (REST API)

Add new books (title, author, genre, price, etc.)

Update existing book information

Delete books from inventory

Search Functionality

Search by title, author, or genre

Paginated search results

Authentication & Authorization

Basic authentication for staff

Admins ‚Üí full CRUD access

Users ‚Üí read-only access

Database Design

PostgreSQL as persistence layer

Entities: Book, Author, Genre with relationships

üõ† Tech Stack

Java + Spring Boot

PostgreSQL (data persistence)

Elasticsearch (search engine)

Flyway (database migrations)

Spring Security (authentication & authorization)

üìä Monitoring & Observability

The Bookstore Service is instrumented with Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer. This enables developers to inspect runtime metrics, timers, and integrate with distributed tracing systems such as Zipkin.

üî¢ Actuator Metrics

Book Creation Counter
Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/book.create.count

This metric tracks the number of books created via the API.

Response includes:

The total count of created books since the application started

Optional tags (if configured, e.g., by user/role)

Example response (JSON):

{
"name": "book.create.count",
"measurements": [
{ "statistic": "COUNT", "value": 5.0 }
],
"availableTags": []
}


Book Search Timer
Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/books.search.timer

This metric measures the time spent searching for books.

Useful for performance monitoring of Elasticsearch queries or repository lookups.

Response includes:

COUNT: how many times the search endpoint has been called

TOTAL_TIME: cumulative execution time (in seconds)

MAX: maximum time observed for a single search

Example response (JSON):

{
"name": "books.search.timer",
"measurements": [
{ "statistic": "COUNT", "value": 12.0 },
{ "statistic": "TOTAL_TIME", "value": 4.182 },
{ "statistic": "MAX", "value": 0.792 }
],
"availableTags": []
}

üîç Distributed Tracing with Zipkin

Traces are exported to Zipkin (default URL: http://localhost:9411/zipkin
)

Each API request (e.g., creating a book or performing a search) will generate a trace ID and span IDs.

You can visualize:

End-to-end request latency

Breakdown of time spent in the database vs. Elasticsearch vs. controller layers

Distributed call chains (useful if you later extend the system into microservices)
