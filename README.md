ookstore Inventory Management System
üîé Overview

The Bookstore Inventory Management System is a RESTful web application designed to help bookstore owners efficiently manage their inventory. It provides a secure API for adding, updating, deleting, and searching books, with support for authentication, authorization, and search functionality.

This project was implemented as a contractor-style assignment, simulating a real-world scenario of delivering a first production-ready version of the system for a customer. The focus is on clean design, extendability, and future maintainability.
